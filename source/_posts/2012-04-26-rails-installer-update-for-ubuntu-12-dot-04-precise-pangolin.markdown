I just updated my simple [Rails Installer](https://github.com/tarakanbg/railsinstaller) script for
compatibility with Ubuntu 12.04. Some extra necessary deb packages were added and the ruby version
is now bumped to 1.9.3. If you don't feel like fiddling with rvm and gemsets, which in my opinion
is seldom necessary anymore with all the latest bundler improvements, you can just grab the script
from [github](https://github.com/tarakanbg/railsinstaller).
