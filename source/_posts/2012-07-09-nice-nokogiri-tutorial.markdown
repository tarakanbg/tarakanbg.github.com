I stumbled upon a nicely written entry-level tutorial about [nokogiri](http://nokogiri.org/), giving a clean,
plain language explanation of the basic gem functionality and methods. The article is part of
[The Bastards Book of Ruby](http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/).

{% blockquote Dan Nguyen http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/chapters/html-parsing/ Parsing HTML with Nokogiri %}
We... saw how to use the web inspector to intercept raw data files. This allows us to read from them directly rather than deal with the data in HTML format... But there will be many instances when you'll need to parse raw HTML. The Ruby gem Nokogiri makes reading raw HTML as easy as crack-parsed XML and JSON.
